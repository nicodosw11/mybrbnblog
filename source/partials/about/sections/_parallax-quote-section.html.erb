    <blockquote>“The most important kind of freedom is to be what you really are. You trade in your reality for a role. You trade in your sense for an act. You give up your ability to feel, and in exchange, put on a mask. There can't be any large-scale revolution until there's a personal revolution, on an individual level. It's got to happen inside first.”<cite>Jim Morrison, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Morrison">Singer, songwriter, and poet.</a></cite></blockquote>
