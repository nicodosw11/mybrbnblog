  after_1: "After a year of intensive practice, I have become aware of what should be my next step in my endeavour to become a strong web developer. First, excellence in Javascript - the language of the browser, and in a framework such as React. Second, Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs, if you want to be serious about programming then you need to develop an extensive knowledge of algorithms to be able to articulate any real-life problem into a programming solution."
  after_2_a: "After getting the basics right, I am now able to move to the next step. Starting with JavaScript, I am committed to build a strong command of the language by developing a number of applications gradually increasing sophistication. I will then strenghten my understanding of React by integrating this framework into my apps. My next step will be to thoroughly learn about algorithms as part of a formal course (such as"
